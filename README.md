# Welcome to the project page for my Senior Integration Paper for Covenant College (May 2021).

### Introduction to Machine Learning and Stewardship

### Abstract
The aim of this study is to provide a biblical perspective to the world of machine learning and an introduction to its uses. This study will also provide templates to build each algorithm and explain the mathematical derivation behind each model. It is important to understand that machine learning is a tool that has and will continue to drastically improve solving complex problems. However, it can easily be used with an sinful mindset to harmfully manipulate data and abuse its power.

# Projects
